# MechHWConsole07

Welcome to console 7 aka the best console! 

To Do:
There is a bug between the TCT game and Poolshot in the UI, but we believe that it could 
be a hardware issue. The Poolshot mechanism needs to be redesigned again as the ball lifter gets stuck frequently as well as the TCT. 
The TCT game lifts up sideways and the cup gets placed weird. Just run it on debug and you will see. 
You should also ask to get another ball stop installed because we are currently using one sensor to control 2 games. 
Additionally, the Friction cars need to be installed. We wrote code for it and most of it should work but needs to be worked on. 
When that is all done, you can begin working on two player mode unless there a new vision ;). 

When you upload code, upload MechHWConsole07_old because we reverted back to old code at Maker Faire and it didn't work so the "old" 
is acutally the new, working code. Feel free to rename it so you know which code to upload. 

The Pachinko game is super sensitive. If the user hits the slider before the ball stops moving then it will break the game. 
The TCT game is also super sensitive. Be careful when you run it because the CAM shaft is fragile as well as the paddle. 
The servo motor was breaking a lot so be careful when reinstalling. Run the code without the silver brackets that attach to the paddle.
This way, you can see where to put the silver brackets and thus not break the servo.
